Dynamic Queue Class

To test the program, for now, add code and run the main. The main has the debugging in it

Main Info
---------
Currently, the main function is being used for debugging. The actual function is still to be implemented. 
The main should demonstrate...
- things can be removed 
- the capacity changes dynamically as the items are added and removed (implemented in debugging stage but needs better demonstration)

- the ability to swap variables (implemented in debugging stage but needs better demonstration)

Changes Made To Original Specs
-----------------------------
- Constructor doesn't have iHead, iTail, and entry_count because they didn't seem necessary when coding
- = overloaded operator was changed to be == overloaded because = cannot be overloaded in python
